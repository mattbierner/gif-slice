# FAQ

## What print resolution / quality can I expect?

Unfortunately most gifs are low resolution and low quality, so you may notice blurriness and image artifacts in your final print. **More abstract slices usually come out better.**

## Will my print have any borders?

Your artwork can go **right up to the edges of the poster**. If you want a border, make sure your slice includes some space around the edges. 

## How are the prints packaged?

Regular prints are shipped in **tubes** (the preferred shipping mechanism for all things internet).

Framed prints are shipped in boxes.

## What about the paper?

Prints use **museum-quality** thick, acid-free matte paper.

## I have a question about my order
